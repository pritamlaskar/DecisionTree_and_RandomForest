# DecisionTree_and_RandomForest
# Decision Tree
The decision tree is a powerful machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks. This implementation provides a flexible and efficient way to build decision trees and make predictions based on the learned model. 

# Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. This implementation in python offers a scalable and efficient framework for training and utilizing random forest models.
