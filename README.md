# DecisionTree_and_RandomForest
# Decision Tree
The decision tree is a powerful machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks. This implementation provides a flexible and efficient way to build decision trees and make predictions based on the learned model. 

# Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. This implementation in python offers a scalable and efficient framework for training and utilizing random forest models.

This repository contains my following projects:</br></br>
• ***DT-RF_EmployeeAttrition***: Prediction of employee attrition using decision tree and random forest of sklearn library. Also contains eda, univariate and multivariate analysis, and multicollinearity check.</br>
• ***Kaggle_TitanicSpaceship***: My work of Kaggle's Titanic Spaceship competition, based on the original Titanic case. Link to dataset and competition -> https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic.
