# DecisionTree_and_RandomForest
# Decision Tree
The decision tree is a powerful machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks. This implementation provides a flexible and efficient way to build decision trees and make predictions based on the learned model. 

# Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. This implementation in python offers a scalable and efficient framework for training and utilizing random forest models.

This repository contains my following projects:</br></br>
• ***DT-RF_EmployeeAttrition***: Prediction of employee attrition using decision tree and random forest of sklearn library. Also contains eda, univariate and multivariate analysis, and multicollinearity check.</br></br>
• ***Kaggle_TitanicSpaceship***: My work on Kaggle's Titanic Spaceship competition, based on the original Titanic case. Link to the dataset and competition -> https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic.</br></br>
• ***Classification_Credit-Card-Fraud***: Fraud detection on credit card transactions using different classification techniques (LR, DT, RF). Area Under Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) is used for evaluation because of the highly imbalanced nature of data. The dataset is provided by the Machine Learning Group, Dept. of Computer Science, Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Belgium.
